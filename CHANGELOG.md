## Openst-notfication v1.0.1
Logger, response helper and web3 from OpenST Base is now used in OpenST notification. OpenST Base repository was created and all the common functionality which different openst modules need were moved to it.

Log level support was introduced and non-important logs were moved to debug log level.

Standardized error codes are now being used in OpenST notification.
